## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-casiljan)

### What is BabylonJS and CannonJS?

[BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) is a complete JavaScript framework for building 3D games and experiences with HTML5, [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), WebVR and Web Audio.

[CannonJS](http://www.cannonjs.org/) is a physics engine, written in JavaScript. And what is a physics engine you might ask? Well its "software that provides an approximate simulation of certain physical systems, such as rigid body dynamics (including collision detection), soft body dynamics, and fluid dynamics, of use in the domains of computer graphics, video games and film."

### What is TypeScript?

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript the compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript starts from the same syntax and semantics that millions of JavaScript developers know today. Use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript code from JavaScript.

TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs on any browser, in Node.js, or in any JavaScript engine that supports [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) 3 (or newer).
